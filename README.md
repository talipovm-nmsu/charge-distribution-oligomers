This code implements the multistate model (MSM) for charge distribution in radical anion or radical cation states of pi-conjugated oligomeric systems. The MSM is a simple model that describes the charge delocalization in molecular systems using a series of parabolic (or other) potentials. 

The model is described in the following paper:

The applications of the model are demonstrated e.g. in these papers:
